@ 20230119 TTD:
    1. What are the fixed points and Jacobian of this system? (What do the eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix mean)
    2. 

@ 20230118 Observations / Results:
    1. Two input projections strongly project to one of the unstable eigenvectors.

@ Meeting on 20230113:
    1. I want to be able to load (multiple) trained agents, and access their connectivity matrix.
        - What is the structure of the network?
    2. Model input (data format & loading) and output (trial visualization)
    3. The analysis that are already done:
        - Eigenvalue plot (how fast to the eigenvalues decay?)
        - Timescale
        - No fixed points (How did you determine that there are no fixed points?)
    4. How are the dynamic regimes found?
    5. Training code (if possible)
    6. Function of each script (if possible)
    7. requirements.txt?
    8. How to install pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail?
    9. README
